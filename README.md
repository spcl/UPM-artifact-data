## Memory Deduplication (Figure 5)

This plot is generated from data on Einstein (System A) with the help of the Jupyter notebook `analysis/plot_function_memory`.
It creates two plots:
* `einstein_vm/plots/memory_411.image-recognition.pdf`
* `einstein_vm/plots/memory_recognition-alexnet.pdf`

## Total System Memory With Deduplication (Figure 6)

This plot is generated from data on Einstein (System A) with the help of the Jupyter notebook `analysis/plot_system_memory`.
It creates one plot:
* `einstein_vm/plots/memory_system.pdf`

## Time Microbenchmark (Figure 7)

This plot is generated from data on CSCS VM (System B) with the help of the Jupyter notebook `analysis/plot_microbenchmark`.
It creates one plot:
* `cscs_vm/plots/microbenchmark.pdf`

## Time Overhead (Figure 8)

This plot is generated from data on CSCS VM (System B) with the help of the Jupyter notebook `analysis/plot_function_time`.
It creates two plots:
* `cscs_vm/plots/time_411.image-recognition.pdf`
* `cscs_vm/plots/time_recognition-alexnet.pdf`
